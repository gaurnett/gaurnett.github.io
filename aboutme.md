My name is Gaurnett Flowers. I am currently a Sophomore at Williams College studing Computer Science. I enjoy coding, playing video games as well as meeting new people. Some of my talents entail playing the guitar and djembe drums. I am apart of the Kusika Dance group on campus. I recently learned to ride a bike but the next thing I want to learn is skateboarding.


- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
