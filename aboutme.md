My name is Gaurnett Flowers. I am currently a Sophomore at Williams College studing Computer Science. I enjoy coding, playing video games as well as meeting new people. Some of my talents entail playing the guitar and djembe drums. I am apart of the Kusika Dance group on campus. I recently learned to ride a bike but the next thing I want to learn is skateboarding.
