## A Good Design!

The Williams' homepage is very aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. It is not complex nor does it have several elements cluttering the page so that it begins to get distracting. With this simplistic design, it allows navigation to feel somewhat easier with a Search and Menu button at the top of the screen. One improvement I would give is that the navigation bar at the top should stay static when the user is scrolling down the page. This will allow them to not worry about having to scroll back to the top if they need to search for something or navigate elsewhere.
