## A Bad Design!

One of the main reasons I find this design to be unappealing is due to the fact that it does not follow the style and theme of all the other main pages on the Williams website. When I first started critquing this page, all I was thinking about was uniformness. I also feel as if certain aspects of the page could be rearranged. The "Application Timeline" menu could have gone to the right, following the style of the "Resources" and "Related Offices" menu.
